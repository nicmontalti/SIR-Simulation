# SIR Simulation
# Building

Compilation is handled by CMake. To compile the code, it is necessary to create a build directory, generate the MakeFile through CMake and execute `make`

## Prerequisites

 - CMake 3.16+
 - SFML 2.5+       (https://www.sfml-dev.org/)
 - ROOT            (https://root.cern/)

## Building and running
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

    ./SIR_simulation
    
## Documentation
The full documentation with some examples can be found in the `\tex` directory (in Italian)
